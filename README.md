##Skin Lesion Detection

#Overview

The Skin Lesion Detection project leverages machine learning techniques to identify and classify skin lesions, such as melanoma, from medical images. The aim is to aid early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes by providing a reliable and efficient automated tool for dermatological analysis.

##Features

Automated classification of skin lesions into multiple categories (e.g., benign, malignant).

Preprocessing techniques for image enhancement and noise reduction.

Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis.

Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess model performance.

User-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing results.

#Technologies Used

Programming Languages: Python

Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Scikit-learn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas

Dataset: Publicly available skin lesion datasets such as ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration)

Prerequisites

Python 3.7+

Necessary libraries (install using the command below):

pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib numpy pandas

##Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing is sourced from the ISIC Archive. It contains labeled dermoscopic images of various skin lesions. Ensure the dataset is downloaded and structured as follows:

/dataset
  /train
    /class_1
    /class_2
    ...
  /test
    /class_1
    /class_2
    ...

#Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/skin-lesion-detection.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd skin-lesion-detection

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Preprocess the dataset:
Run the preprocessing script to resize and normalize images.

python preprocess.py

Train the model:
Train the CNN model using the prepared dataset.

python train.py

Evaluate the model:
Test the trained model and view the performance metrics.

python evaluate.py

Detect lesions:
Use the trained model to classify new images.

python detect.py --image-path <path_to_image>

Results

Achieved accuracy: 88%



Visualizations of model performance and sample predictions are available in the results/ directory.

#Future Work

Expand the model to include more classes of skin conditions.

Improve accuracy using advanced architectures like EfficientNet or Vision Transformers.

Deploy the model as a web application for real-time diagnosis.
